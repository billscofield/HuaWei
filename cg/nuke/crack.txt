SINGLE MACHINE
1.Install Your Foundry Product
2.Install FLT7 (follow the docs for any custom installation)    (If you already have our rlm server working and running , jump to step 8) 
  for 64bit-linux : tar xvzf FLT7.1v1-linux-x86-release-64.tgz 
                    cd FLT_7.1v1_linux-x86-release-64RH
                    ./install.sh
3.Stop Foundry License Server (one way is /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s stop -t RLM)
4.Copy the cracked rlm.foundry over the original one (/usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/bin/RLM/rlm.foundry" 
  (keep permissions or just do a chmod 755 on cracked rlm.foundry if you didnt overwrite)
5.Edit xf_foundry.lic replacing HOST_NAME MAC_ADDRESS PORT . You can get those informations using rlmutil (./rlmutil rlmhostid host and ./rlmutil rlmhostid)
  PORT is by default 4102 if you dont put any (dont forget to delete the word PORT then if you dont want to specify one) . If you need more infos read RLM manual.

6.Copy the xf_foundry.lic to /usr/local/foundry/RLM 
7.Restart RLM Server you can do that from inetd/services or just with Foundry License Utility (the best way to check logs and infos)
  /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s stop -t RLM
  /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s start -t RLM
  or to get a status /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s status -t RLM

8.Start Your Foundry Product and Enjoy ut !!

XFORCE SMOKED it again !


MULTIPLE MACHINES
Machine A acting as rlm license server
1.Install FLT7
2.Stop Foundry License Server
3.Copy the cracked rlm.foundry over the original one (/usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/bin/RLM/rlm.foundry"
4.Edit xf_foundry.lic replacing HOST_NAME MAC_ADDRESS PORT . You can get those informations using rlmutil (./rlmutil rlmhostid host and ./rlmutil rlmhostid)
  PORT is by default 5053 if you dont put any (dont forget to delete the word PORT then if you dont want to specify one) . If you need more infos read RLM manual.
5.Copy the xf_foundry.lic to /usr/local/foundry/RLM
6.Restart RLM Server you can do that from inetd/services or just with Foundry License Utility (the best way to check logs and infos)
  /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s stop -t RLM
  /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s start -t RLM
  or to get a status /usr/local/foundry/LicensingTools7.1/FoundryLicenseUtility -s status -t RLM


Machine B,C,D,... acting as rlm clients
1.Install your Foundry Product
2.Start your Foundry product
3.You will be prompter to activate, Click on Activate License or Use Server
  As license server you must enter this : port_of_rlm_server@ip_of_rlmserver Those are the infos from Machine A
                                          if you didnt specify a port it will look like this : 5053@ip_of_machineA
  Do not forget to make sure your firewall accepts communication with the clients (disable it to check)

  You can ALSO set env variables (read DOC) 

TIPS:
Foundry License Utility will help you find infos on hostname, hostid, systemid, mac address, port and problems you may run into if
you didnt follow our steps .. Diagnostics will help you figure out what mistake you did.
You can also check a few infos on the web gui : http://127.0.0.1:4102 or http://rlm_ip:4102
