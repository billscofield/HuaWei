        方法一
            新建一个环境变量:
                Maya_ui_language -> en_US
                zh_CN

        方法二:
            安装文件夹/resources/I10n/zh_CN     //使用的是中文版，就是 zh_CN, 改为 en_US 就是英文



cpu

    Modeling and animation in Maya are primarily **single-threaded**, so you want a CPU
    with the highest possible clock speed – but core count is not particularly
    important. 

gpu

    Do I need to use a Quadro card for Maya or is GeForce okay?

    Maya needs a fairly powerful video card, unless you are exclusively
    rendering, and Autodesk’s official stance is that NVIDIA’s professional
    graphics cards (formerly Quadro) are certified for this application. They
    do also test GeForce cards, so those should work fine for most users and
    may be preferred for those working in game dev, but pro-grade cards are
    optimized by NVIDIA to be more reliable in the long-term.
