## find

-print0
    True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the new‐
    line  character that -print uses).  This allows file names that contain newlines or other types of white
    space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the find output.  This option corresponds  to
    the -0 option of xargs.




## tar

The  --null option instructs tar that the names in FILE are separated by ASCII
NUL character, instead of LF.  It is useful if the list is generated by find(1)
-print0 predicate.


``` 
➜  os git:(master) ✗ find . -iname "*.md" -print0
./os.md./fork.md#                                                                                                   


➜  os git:(master) ✗ ll
total 24K
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 360 Mar  4 16:27 fork.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 20K Mar  4 13:40 os.md

```



-T, --files-from=FILE
    Get names to extract or create from FILE.

    Unless  specified  otherwise, the FILE must contain a list of names
    separated by ASCII LF (i.e. one name per line).  The names read are handled
    the same way as command line arguments.  They undergo  quote  re‐ moval and
    word splitting, and any string that starts with a - is handled as tar
    command line option.

    If this behavior is undesirable, it can be turned off using the
    --verbatim-files-from option.

    The  --null option instructs tar that the names in FILE are separated by
    ASCII NUL character, instead of LF.  It is useful if the list is generated
    by find(1) -print0 predicate.
