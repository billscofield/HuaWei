/var/log

/run

一般是二进制文件，需要专门的软件

### w

The  following entries are displayed for each user: 

    login name, the tty name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the command line of their current process.
                                                login@

The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.  It does not include past  background
jobs, but does include currently running background jobs.

The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the "what" field.

### lastlog

所有用户最后一次


### lastb   (bad)

/var/log/btmp



last  searches  back through the /var/log/wtmp file (or the file designated by the -f option) and displays a list of all
users logged in (and out) since that file was created.  One or more usernames and/or ttys can be given,  in  which  case
last  will show only the entries matching those arguments.  Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as
last tty0.

When catching a SIGINT signal (generated by the interrupt key, usually control-C) or a SIGQUIT signal,  last  will  show
how far it has searched through the file; in the case of the SIGINT signal last will then terminate.

The  pseudo  user  reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted.  Thus last reboot will show a log of all the reboots
since the log file was created.

lastb is the same as last, except that by default it shows a log of the /var/log/btmp file, which contains all  the  bad
login attempts.
