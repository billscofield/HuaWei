## procps

procps is a set of command line and full-screen utilities that provide
information out of the pseudo-filesystem most commonly located at /proc.  This
filesystem provides a simple interface to the kernel data structures.  The
programs of procps generally concentrate on the structures that describe the
processess running on the system.


## procps-ng

Command line and full screen utilities for browsing procfs, a "pseudo" file
system dynamically generated by the kernel to provide information about the
status of entries in its process table.


## Difference

1. By default, ps selects all processes whith the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker.
2. Output is unsorted by default

    - process ID (pid=PID)
    - the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY)
    - the calculated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:sss formata (time]=TIME)
    - the executable name (ucmd=CMD)

BSD style
    - add process stat (stat=STAT) to the default display 
    - show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the executable name
