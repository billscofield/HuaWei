## Why are daemons called daemons?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29#Etymology

According to Fernando J. Corbato who worked on Project MAC in 1963 his team is
the first to use the term daemon. The use of the term daemon was inspired by
Maxwell's daemon, in physics and thermodynamics as an imaginary agent which
helped to sort molecules.

"We fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes
which worked tirelessly to perform system chores."

In the Unix System Administration Handbook, Evi Nemeth states the following
about daemons:

"Many people equate the word "daemon" with the word "demon", implying some kind
of satanic connection between UNIX and the underworld. This is an egregious
misunderstanding. "Daemon" is actually a much older form of "demon"; daemons
have no particular bias towards good or evil, but rather serve to help define a
person's character or personality. The ancient Greeks' concept of a "personal
daemon" was similar to the modern concept of a "guardian angel"—eudaemonia is
the state of being helped or protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX
systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons."


克斯韦妖（Maxwell's demon），是在物理学中假想的妖，能探测并控制单个分子的运动，
于1871年由英国物理学家詹姆斯·麦克斯韦为了说明违反热力学第二定律的可能性而设想的
。

当时麦克斯韦意识到自然界存在着与熵增加相拮抗的能量控制机制。但他无法清晰地说明
这种机制。他只能诙谐地假定一种“妖”，能够按照某种秩序和规则把作随机热运动的微粒
分配到一定的相格里。麦克斯韦妖是耗散结构的一个雏形。
