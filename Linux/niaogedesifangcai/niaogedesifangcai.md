## Page 11 QPI DMI and Hyper transport

"QPI vs DMI" is a completely false dichotomy.

DMI is used by both processors to connect the northbridge (or what used to be
northbridge) to the PCH aka southbridge.

QPI is used to connect the socket 1366 processors to the northbridge, while the
northbridge is completely incorporated into socket 1155 processors, so no QPI
bus is possible or necessary there.

https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/HyperTransport

HyperTransport is a high-speed, point-to-point, 32-bit technology for data
transfer within the integrated circuits ( IC s ) in computers and other
devices. The technology allows data throughput in excess of 12.8 gigabytes per
second (GB/sec). HyperTransport was developed by AMD in cooperation with
several other companies, and is a trademark(商标,标志) of the HyperTransport
Consortium(联盟).

Computers using HyperTransport are characterized by low latency(延迟) ,
compatibility with most operating system s, low pin count, scalability , and
extensibility to advanced bus architectures. HyperTransport will work with a
wide variety of input-output (I/O) devices, and a single channel can
accommodate( 容纳；使适应) multiple devices.

HyperTransport is aimed at applications that require greater bandwidth than
other current technologies allow. HyperTransport has obvious advantages in
applications such as high-end animation programs, simulation programs, robot
control, medical devices, and virtual reality . Some engineers envision(想象;
预想) the eventual use of this technology in general consumer appliances and
electronic devices.
