本来(1998年以前）一直都是1024来着，后来有人（国际电工委员会）提出km,kg,kl这些公制单位都是按1000的，凭什么kb就不是呢？

所以为了 让一般人计算的更方便，于是就采用了1000的标准了。

Prefixes for binary multiples
In December 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the leading international organization for worldwide standardization in electrotechnology, approved as an IEC International Standard names and symbols for prefixes for binary multiples for use in the fields of data processing and data transmission. The prefixes are as follows:

Prefixes for binary multiples
 Factor 	Name 	Symbol 	Origin	Derivation 
 210	kibi	Ki	kilobinary: (210)1	kilo: (103)1
 220	mebi	Mi	megabinary: (210)2 	mega: (103)2
 230	gibi	Gi	gigabinary: (210)3	giga: (103)3
 240	tebi	Ti	terabinary: (210)4	tera: (103)4
 250	pebi	Pi	petabinary: (210)5	peta: (103)5
 260	exbi	Ei	exabinary:  (210)6	exa: (103)6

Examples and comparisons with SI prefixes
one kibibit	     1 Kibit = 210 bit  = 1024 bit
one kilobit	     1 kbit  = 103 bit  = 1000 bit
one byte	     1 B     = 23  bit  = 8 bit
one mebibyte	 1 MiB   = 220 B    = 1 048 576 B
one megabyte	 1 MB    = 106 B    = 1 000 000 B
one gibibyte	 1 GiB   = 230 B    = 1 073 741 824 B
one gigabyte	 1 GB    = 109 B    = 1 000 000 000 B
It is suggested that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as "bee."

It is important to recognize that the new prefixes for binary multiples are not part of the International System of Units (SI), the modern metric system. However, for ease of understanding and recall, they were derived from the SI prefixes for positive powers of ten. As can be seen from the above table, the name of each new prefix is derived from the name of the corresponding SI prefix by retaining the first two letters of the name of the SI prefix and adding the letters "bi," which recalls the word "binary." Similarly, the symbol of each new prefix is derived from the symbol of the corresponding SI prefix by adding the letter "i," which again recalls the word "binary." (For consistency with the other prefixes for binary multiples, the symbol Ki is used for 210 rather than ki.)

Official publication
These prefixes for binary multiples, which were developed by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 25, Quantities and units, and their letter symbols, with the strong support of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), were first adopted by the IEC as Amendment 2 to IEC International Standard IEC 60027-2: Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics. The full content of Amendment 2, which has a publication date of 1999-01, is reflected in the tables above and the suggestion regarding pronunciation. Subsequently the contents of this Amendment were incorportated in the second edition of IEC 60027-2, which has a publication date of 2000-11 (the first edition was published in 1972). The complete citation for this revised standard is IEC 60027-2, Second edition, 2000-11, Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics.

Historical context
Once upon a time, computer professionals noticed that 210 was very nearly equal to 1000 and started using the SI prefix "kilo" to mean 1024. That worked well enough for a decade or two because everybody who talked kilobytes knew that the term implied 1024 bytes. But, almost overnight a much more numerous "everybody" bought computers, and the trade computer professionals needed to talk to physicists and engineers and even to ordinary people, most of whom know that a kilometer is 1000 meters and a kilogram is 1000 grams.

Then data storage for gigabytes, and even terabytes, became practical, and the storage devices were not constructed on binary trees, which meant that, for many practical purposes, binary arithmetic was less convenient than decimal arithmetic. The result is that today "everybody" does not "know" what a megabyte is. When discussing computer memory, most manufacturers use megabyte to mean 220 = 1 048 576 bytes, but the manufacturers of computer storage devices usually use the term to mean 1 000 000 bytes. Some designers of local area networks have used megabit per second to mean 1 048 576 bit/s, but all telecommunications engineers use it to mean 106 bit/s. And if two definitions of the megabyte are not enough, a third megabyte of 1 024 000 bytes is the megabyte used to format the familiar 90 mm (3 1/2 inch), "1.44 MB" diskette. The confusion is real, as is the potential for incompatibility in standards and in implemented systems.

Faced with this reality, the IEEE Standards Board decided that IEEE standards will use the conventional, internationally adopted, definitions of the SI prefixes. Mega will mean 1 000 000, except that the base-two definition may be used (if such usage is explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis) until such time that prefixes for binary multiples are adopted by an appropriate standards body.

早期 Apple 认为1GB=1 000 000 000字节，Microsoft认为1GB=1 073 741 824字节，网络上多用Microsoft的标准。对于电脑而言，1 073 741 824是2的30次方，比1 000 000 000更方便处理，但硬件厂商生产硬盘等设备的时候是按后者来标注容量的。

Apple希望用户买一块1TB的硬盘插到电脑上看到的就是1TB而不是931GB，这会带来更好的用户体验，于是Apple在显示容量时遵循了后者的标准。




IEC制定二进制前缀标准的原因是因为一直以来使用混乱，但影响不大就算了，但现在这个影响可能会很大。举两个很经典的使用混乱例子：1.44M的3.5寸软盘，规格是双面80轨18扇区，每扇区512字节，不管用1000进制还是用1024进制，都算不出来1.44这个数出来。除了存储容量外，另一个经常混淆使用1000和1024的地方是网络带宽。宽带供应商说给你装百兆宽带，通常是100Mbps=100*1000*1000 bit/s。但网络工程师看下载速度的时候，说带宽有12.5 MB/s，通常是12.5*1024*1024=13,107,200 Byte/s=104,857,600 bit/s使用混乱的话，1024和1000相比，差异不过2.4%，大部分时候这个误差影响不大。但是现在硬盘动则上T，假设你找厂家搞个1 PB的存储系统，实际只有909.49 TiB，误差已经达到9.05%，不能完全忽略了。
