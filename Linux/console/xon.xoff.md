## XON/XOFF

https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/x/xonxoff.htm

Alternatively referred to as **software flow control**, XON/XOFF or XON and
XOFF are control characters used in data transmission. XOFF is used by a
receiving device as a way to let the transmitting device know it needs to stop
transmitting. When the device is ready to recommence, the XON character is
sent. With most environments, XOFF is achieved by pressing **Ctrl+S** and XON
is achieved by pressing **Ctrl+Q**. Some Sun, Linux, and Unix computers have a
"Stop" key on the keyboard stops and starts text on the screen.
