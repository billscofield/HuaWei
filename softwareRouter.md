## NFV - Computer Definition
    (Network Functions Virtualization) Virtualizing networking functions in commodity hardware rather than specialized devices. NFV is complementary to software-defined networking, in which fixed-function routing has been placed under software control. NFV deals with the many other devices in a network. For example, with NFV, dedicated hardware boxes such as CDN appliances, access servers, WAN accelerators and monitors become virtual appliances in standard server hardware. See software-defined networking, virtual appliance and virtual router.
