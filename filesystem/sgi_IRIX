IRIX是由硅谷图形公司（Silicon Graphics Inc.，一般用简称：SGI，美国图形工作站生产厂商）以System V与BSD延伸程序为基础所发展成的UNIX操作系统

美国硅图公司成立于1982年，是一个生产高性能计算机系统的跨国公司

世界著名的数字工作室Digital Domain公司用了一年半的时间，动用了300多台SGI超级工作站，并派出50多个特技师一天24小时轮流制作「泰坦尼克号」中的电脑特技。

XFS is a high-performance 64-bit journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI) in 1993.

Silicon Graphics began development of the Extents File System or XFS in 1993, including it in IRIX for the first time in IRIX version 5.3 in 1994. 

The file system was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in May 2000. 

A team led by Steve Lord at SGI ported it to Linux, and first support by a Linux distribution came in 2001. This support gradually became available in almost all Linux distributions.




A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system's main part by recording the intentions of such changes in a data structure known as a "journal", which is usually a circular log. In the event of a system crash or power failure, such file systems can be brought back online more quickly with a lower likelihood of becoming corrupted.
