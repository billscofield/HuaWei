### DVD

VIDEO_TS
AUDIO_TS

If you look at the files on a DVD, you will notice that most DVDs have both a
VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS folder, but the AUDIO_TS folder is usually empty.
DVD-Audio would be stored in an AUDIO_TS folder but is a separate format to
DVD-Video.

The TS stands for "title set" and is part of DVD structure. The before
mentioned VIDEO_TS folder will hold all the pertinent information such as
Informaton (IFO) and any backup (BUP) files that are necessary for the DVD to
even be read.

The empty AUDIO_TS folder is normally required for the disc to be recognized as
a working DVD.
