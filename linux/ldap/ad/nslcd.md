Naming services LDAP client daemon

nslcd is a daemon that will do LDAP queries for local processes that want to do
user, group and other naming lookups (NSS) or do user authentication,
authorisation or password modification (PAM).

nslcd is configured through a configuration file (see nslcd.conf(5)).

See the included README for information on configuring the LDAP server.
