getent - get entries from Name Service Switch libraries

The getent command displays entries from databases supported by the Name
Service Switch libraries, which are configured in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

supplied keys will be displayed.  Otherwise, if no key is provided, all entries
will be displayed (unless the database does not support enumeration) .
