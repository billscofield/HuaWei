## Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a cloud computing service in Amazon
Web Services (AWS) that manages containers and allows developers to run
applications in the cloud without having to configure an environment for the
code to run in. It enables developers with AWS accounts to deploy and manage
scalable applications that run on groups of servers -- called clusters --
through application program interface (API) calls and task definitions. Amazon
ECS is a scalable service that is accessible through the AWS Management Console
and software development kits (SDKs).

Amazon developed ECS in response to the rise in popularity of containerization.
ECS enables a developer to specify rules for isolated sets of EC2 instances
which increase portability and computing performance by running on top of a
host operating system (OS). ECS supports Docker, an open source Linux container
service.

Amazon ECS enables developers to easily use Docker containers for a range of
activities; from hosting a simple website to running complex, distributed
microservices that require thousands of containers. ECS evaluates and monitors
CPU and memory output to determine the optimal deployment for a container. AWS
customers can also use the service to update containers or scale them up or
down. AWS Elastic Load Balancing (AWS ELB), Elastic Block Store (AWS EBS)
volumes and Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) roles are also supported
for further customization.


## Uses of Amazon Elastic Container Service

Amazon ECS is best used with:

    1. Machine learning - Machine learning (ML) models can be easily
       containerized for training and inference with Amazon ECS. ML models can
       be created with loosely coupled, distributed services that can be placed
       on a variety of platforms or close to the data that's being analyzed by
       the application.

    1. Microservices - Amazon ECS assists in the operation of microservices
       applications by providing native integration to AWS and enabling
       continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

    1. Virtual machines - The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) web
       service can be used to create and operate Linux virtual machines (VMs)
       in the cloud; these VMs are called instances. Developers can specify
       rules for the isolated sets of EC2 instances which increase computing
       performance and portability by running on top of a host operating
       system.

    1. Migrating apps to the cloud - Legacy enterprise applications can be
       feasibly containerized and migrated to Amazon ECS without necessitating
       any code changes.

    1. Batch processing - Batch workloads can be run with custom or managed
       schedulers on AWS On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances or Spot
       Instances.
