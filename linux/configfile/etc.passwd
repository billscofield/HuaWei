# password

The salt is used as a random string of characters that is added to the
plaintext password before hashing. This helps to increase the security of
password storage, as the same password will have a different hash when a
different salt is used.

The encryption used for password storage in Linux systems is typically a
one-way hash function, such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512. These functions
take the password and salt as inputs and produce a fixed-length hash value as
output. The resulting hash is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file, which is only
readable by the root user.

The encryption used for password storage can be recognized by the prefix in the
password field of the `/etc/shadow` file. For example, a password hash starting
with $1$ indicates that MD5 was used, while a hash starting with $6$ indicates
that SHA-512 was used. The prefix is followed by the salt and the hashed
password, separated by the $ character.

It is important to note that the use of MD5 for password storage is no longer
considered secure, as it is vulnerable to various attacks. It is recommended to
use SHA-256 or SHA-512 instead.

please give an example how the passwd in `/etc/passwd` is encrypted Sure! In
Linux, the password in the `/etc/passwd` file is actually stored as a hashed
value, which is created by applying a one-way cryptographic function (such as
MD5 or SHA-256) to the user's password and a random salt value. Here is an
example of how this works:

Let's say that the user's password is "password123" and the system generates a
random salt value of "abc123". The system then concatenates the salt value with
the password to get "abc123password123".

Next, the system applies a one-way cryptographic function (such as SHA-256) to
this concatenated value to create a hashed value, which is stored in the
`/etc/passwd` file. The resulting hashed value might look something like this:

`$5$abc123$9LtnYJ4lq3y3cxz6LkkljKgDIJ8OvZ1QzOx9ZZPYe2B`

Here, the hashed value starts with $5$ to indicate that SHA-256 was used. The
next field "abc123" is the salt value that was used. The rest of the hashed
value represents the result of applying the SHA-256 function to the
concatenated salt and password.

When the user enters their password to log in, the system retrieves the hashed
value from the `/etc/passwd` file, extracts the salt value and applies the same
cryptographic function to the entered password and the extracted salt. If the
resulting hashed value matches the one stored in `/etc/passwd`, then the user is
authenticated and allowed to log in.
