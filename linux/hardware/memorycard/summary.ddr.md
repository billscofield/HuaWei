1. part number

    (often abbreviated “P/N”)uniquely identifies a specific design of a part or
    assembly (which may or may not account for variations or optional features), 

2. serial number

    (often abbreviated “S/N”) uniquely identifies a single specific unit;


Sometimes the serial number is unique across all products a manufacturer has
made, but sometimes it is unique only across the production of a single part
number, model, or family.

The manufacturer should keep a database of the serial numbers it has assigned
along with any relevant information they may want for reference in the future:
production date, configuration and revision, the serial numbers of any
subassemblies that may have gone into that unit, or even the customer it was
ultimately sold to.



The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and International Mobile Equipment
Identity (IMEI) are two examples of industry-standardized serial numbers that
you may have heard of.
