# xterm

apt-cache show xterm

This package provides four commands:

1. **xterm**, which is the traditional terminal emulator;

2. **uxterm**, which is a wrapper around xterm that is intelligent about locale
settings (especially those which use the UTF-8 character encoding), but which
requires the luit program from the x11-utils package; 

3. **koi8rxterm**, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the KOI8-R
character set;

4. **lxterm**, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the previous commands to
execute based on the user's locale settings.
