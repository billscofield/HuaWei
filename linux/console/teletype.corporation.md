The Teletype Corporation, a part of American Telephone and Telegraph Company's
Western Electric manufacturing(制造业) arm(部门) since 1930, came into being in 1928 when the
Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company changed its name to the name of its trademark
equipment. Teletype Corporation, of Skokie, Illinois, was responsible for the
research, development and manufacture of data and record communications
equipment, but it is primarily remembered for the manufacture of
electromechanical teleprinters.

        Edward Kleinschmidt was a lifelong inventor and one of the fathers of
        the telecommunications industry. Throughout his career, he continually
        innovated and improved communication technologies. And throughout its
        history, Kleinschmidt Inc. has continuously evolved, always seeking new
        ways to help organizations communicate and connect.
        
        1903, At age 22, Edward Kleinschmidt opens an experimental shop with a
        sign over the door reading “Inventions Developed.” It’s both a personal
        workshop and a technical consultancy where he helps customers develop
        new products.
        
        1914, Innovation in telecommunication, The Kleinschmidt Electric Company
        is founded to engineer the beginnings of what would become the
        teletypewriter/teleprinter, which enables telegraph operators to type
        and receive messages directly on typewriter terminals instead of
        sending and translating Morse code. Edward applies to patent the
        type-bar page printer, laying the groundwork for future technologies. 
        
        1919, Competing patents and friendly mergers, The Morkrum Company and
        Klein­schmidt Electric Company both file patents for start-stop
        synchro­nizing methods for code telegraph systems. Instead of wasting
        time in patent disputes, Sterling Morton, Charles Krum and Edward
        Klein­schmidt decide to merge the two companies to form the
        Morkrum-Klein­schmidt company in 1924 (becoming the TeleType
        Corporation in 1928) and continue to improve the machine together.
        
        1930, Bought by AT&T, In 1928, Klein­schmidt Electric Company becomes
        The Teletype Corporation, which is purchased by AT&T for $30,000,000 in
        1930.
        
        1931, Kleinschmidt Labs, Kleinschmidt immediately turns around and sets
        up Kleinschmidt Laboratories to continue his work, and is commissioned
        by the U.S. Army Signal Corps during WWII to develop the fastest data
        printer possible.
        
        1949, A big order changes everything, The Klein­schmidt 100 wpm typebar
        page printer becomes the standard for the U.S. Military. To meet an
        order for 2,000 printers Klein­schmidt purchases of 13 acres in
        Deerfield Illinois and sets up a manu­fac­turing facility.
        Klein­schmidt, Inc. still proudly occupies the same land today.

The Western Electric Company was an American electrical engineering and
manufacturing company officially founded in 1869. A wholly owned subsidiary( [s
əbˈsɪdiəri] 子公司) of AT&T for most of its lifespan(寿命), it served as the
primary equipment manufacturer, supplier, and purchasing agent(采购代理) for
the Bell System from 1881 to 1984 when it was dismantled( [dɪsˈmæntl] 拆开 ).
The company was responsible for many technological innovations([ˌɪnəˈveɪʃn] 创
新) as well as developments in industrial management.
